> *"The harness — not the model — is the bottleneck."*
> — Can Bölük, [*The Harness Problem*](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem)

Most edit tools ask the model to echo the old code **token-for-token** before it can change anything
— and that's exactly where agents fail: 46–51% patch-format failure rates for several models with
replace-style edits. **dsh-better-edit** goes deeper. Every line of a file gets a unique 3-character
content hash, and edits target hashes. The old text is never echoed, anchors survive edits, and every
resolved range is verified against exactly what the model saw — wrong-line edits cannot silently land.

## Why you need this

`str_replace` makes the model re-type the code it's replacing — pure transcription cost (output tokens, billed ~5-6× input), and where agents fail most: 46–51% patch failures on real models, worse on bigger blocks, each failure costing a re-read and a retry.

Hashline sends two hashes instead of the old text — **34% fewer edit tokens** (46% on multi-line ranges) — and verifies every range against what the model saw: an edit lands where you meant, or fails loudly with fresh anchors. Anchors are content addresses that survive edits above, so chained edits skip re-reads — and a leaner context keeps the model's attention on the code, not on re-transcribing it.

Not for one-line touch-ups (near parity) or new files (`write`). It pays off in long sessions and structural edits — anywhere an edit must not land on the wrong line.

## Quick Start

### Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-better-edit   # from npm
dsh plugin --profile <name> add /path/to/dsh-better-edit   # from a local checkout
```

The profile's next session runs with the hashline tools installed. To verify the layer is active:

```sh
dsh --profile <name> --dump-config   # shows a "# == dsh-better-edit" layer
```

| Requirement | |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` (dsh's requirement; the store uses `node:sqlite`) |
| Profile | a dsh profile (`dsh plugin` initializes one on first use) |
| Backends | sandboxed / remote filesystems supported (writes go through `ctx.fs`) |

`read` returns every line prefixed by its hash — the hash *is* the line's address:

```text
ve7│function hello() {
szJ│  console.log("world");
kQm│}
```

`edit` targets a range of hashes, so edits always land on the lines you meant:

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.ts",
  "remove_from": "szJ",
  "remove_to": "szJ",
  "replacement_text": "  console.log('hi');"
}
```

and produces a diff with fresh anchors, so the next edit verifies cleanly with no re-read:

```text
− szJ │   console.log("world");
+ a3m │   console.log('hi');
  kQm │ }
```

## Why Hashline

**Token-saving.** An edit call carries `remove_from` / `remove_to` (two 3-char hashes) plus the
replacement text — it never echoes the text being replaced. A `str_replace` call must reproduce that
text verbatim. On a 12-edit session over a realistic file this is **34% fewer output tokens** (46%
on multi-line ranges) — and these are *output* tokens, billed at ~5-6× the input rate. See the
[benchmark](#benchmark).

**But this was never about “fewest tokens.”** Savings scale with the replaced text — near parity on
one-line touch-ups — and a compact patch language like [@oh-my-pi/hashline](#how-it-compares) can
emit a lighter payload still (44–55% on the same session). The point is the *right* kind of edit
call: no re-typing old code, and nothing for the model to track except two stable content addresses.

**Correctness.** Every resolved edit range is verified against the exact lines the model was shown.
A stale, never-served, or ambiguous range is hard-rejected **before anything is written**, and the
current range is echoed back as fresh anchors (reject-and-serve) — the retry needs no `read`.

**A modern edit pattern for agents.** Content-addressed anchors are line-number-agnostic: edit one
part of a file and the hashes of the rest stay put, so chained edits need no re-reads. The model
pins a line by what it *is*, not by where it used to sit.

### How It Compares

| | hashline `edit` | `str_replace` (Claude Code / Codex) | @oh-my-pi/hashline patch |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Replaced text never echoed in the call | ✅ 2 hashes only | ❌ verbatim | ✅ `+` rows only |
| Lines addressed by | content hash | text match | number + file-content tag |
| Verified against what the model saw | ✅ every line | ❌ first match wins | ~ file version only |
| Stale file detected | ✅ rejects, fresh anchors | ❌ may match wrong spot | ✅ tag mismatch → refuse or 3-way merge |
| Anchors survive edits above | ✅ content-addressed | ✅ content-based | ❌ renumber + new tag |
| Chained edits without re-reads | ✅ diff serves fresh anchors | ~ | ~ via edit-response numbers |
| Unambiguous when text repeats | ✅ boundary anchors verified | ❌ first occurrence | ~ position, unverified per line |
| Wrong-line edit never lands silently | ✅ every line verified | ❌ first match wins | ~ possible in principle (tag checks version, not lines) |
| Block ops / registers / `MV` / `REM` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| One document per change | ❌ per-edit call | ❌ per-edit call | ✅ multi-hunk patch |
| Runtime | ✅ Node (dsh) | — | ⚠️ Bun only |
| Undo | ✅ persisted | ❌ | ❌ not in scope |

> `~` = occasionally / inconsistently. `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a compact line-anchored patch language
> ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/hashline), [repo](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/tree/main/packages/hashline)):
> `[path#tag]` headers bind each hunk to a full-file content hash, `PUT N.=M:` addresses lines by
> number, and every edit renumbers — take the next numbers and tag from the edit response or a fresh `read`.

**Different jobs, same lineage.** Both descend from the
[harness-problem](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) insight that the model should never
re-type old code. `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a **patch-language library** — payload-light (44% saved
per edit, 55% in a single batch document, see [benchmark](#benchmark)), with syntactic block ops
(`PUT N*:`), registers, `REM`/`MV`, multi-hunk documents, a pluggable filesystem for any backend,
and session-aware 3-way-merge recovery on stale tags. This plugin is a **dsh tool pair**: `read`
hands the model 3-char content hashes, `edit` takes two of them, and every resolved line is verified
against the served state — no line numbers to renumber, no tag to re-fetch, a wrong anchor can never
land on the wrong line, and `undo_last_edit` survives restarts. Its trade-offs: a JSON envelope per
edit costs a little payload, there are no block ops, and it lives inside dsh (Node) rather than as a
standalone patcher (Bun). Pick hashline-the-library for a cross-backend patch format; pick
hashline-the-tool for verified, content-addressed edits in your agent.

### Correctness in edge cases

The token benchmark measures the payload the model emits — it assumes the model gets every
address right, for free. Correctness is where the two hashline implementations actually diverge.
These are the real failure modes from the harness-problem literature (wrong-line edits, drift,
repeated text), and what each tool does when they hit:

| Edge case | hashline `edit` (this plugin) | @oh-my-pi/hashline patch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wrong address (off-by-one anchor / line number) | **Impossible** — anchors resolve to specific lines; every resolved line is verified against served state, rejected **before** anything is written | **Possible** — a wrong line number against a current tag applies **silently** at the wrong place; the tag proves the file version, never the lines |
| File changed on disk after the model's view | Hard reject + fresh anchors echoed (reject-and-serve); retry needs no `read` | Tag mismatch → refuse **or best-effort 3-way merge** onto unknown current content |
| An edit above shifts the file | Nothing shifts — anchors are content addresses; the diff serves fresh anchors | **Every edit renumbers** — “RE-GROUND AFTER EVERY EDIT” is the format's own #1 rule; the model carries the bookkeeping |
| Repeated / identical text | Per-line hashes are unique (collision-resolved); ambiguity → `[E_AMBIGUOUS_ANCHOR]` | Position-based, so repeats don't confuse it — but the position itself is unverified |
| Lines never shown to the model | `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` — hard reject with fresh anchors | Undisplayed hunks rejected — same reliance on the model knowing what it saw |
| Mid-expression / wrong block node | Irrelevant — any verified line range is valid | Grammar rules + `PUT N*:` node choice; mispointing (anchoring `def` orphans its decorator) silently lands wrong; no syntax check |
| Multi-edit batch fails mid-way | `batch_edit` — all items are preflighted; writes are sequential with best-effort rollback | Multi-section patches preflighted up front — commit semantics depend on the filesystem |

> The 44–55% oh-my-pi payload saving is a lighter wire format; the table above is what that
> format asks the model to hold in its head instead — renumbering, tag-chasing, node choice —
> the exact component that fails most (46–51% patch-failure rates on replace-style edits). This
> plugin's 34% is the price of a contract where a wrong edit cannot land, and any rejection
> needs no re-read.

## Benchmark

Measured on the same 103-line file with the same 12 replacements (8 single-line, 4 multi-line of
3/6/10/15 lines), tokenized with the pinned `js-tiktoken` `cl100k_base`. Three arms emit the same
replacements: this plugin's `edit` (two 3-char anchors), a `str_replace` tool (old text echoed
verbatim), and [`@oh-my-pi/hashline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oh-my-pi/hashline) in both of
its modes — one `[path#tag]` section per edit (`seq`) and one multi-hunk batch document (`batch`):

| Criterion | hashline | str_replace | oh-my-pi seq / batch |
| ----------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Replaced text sent over the wire | ✅ never | ❌ every edit | ✅ never |
| Output tokens saved (12-edit session) | ✅ **34%** | ❌ 0% | ✅ **44% / 55%** |
| Multi-line range savings (3–15 lines) | ✅ **31–50%** | ❌ 0% | ✅ **40–52%** |
| Effective cost at 5× output pricing | ✅ **~1.4× less** | ❌ 1× | ✅ **~1.7× / ~2.1× less** |
| Ranges verified against served state | ✅ 100% | ❌ none | ~ file version only |
| Line numbers the model must track | ✅ none — content anchors | ✅ none — text match | ❌ renumber every edit |
| Deterministic, reproducible locally | ✅ `npm run benchmark` | — | — |

### Reproducible

The numbers above are **deterministic and you can reproduce them locally** — `npm run benchmark`:

| Scenario | Lines | hashline | str_replace | oh-my-pi seq | oh-my-pi batch |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| single-line ×8 | 1 | 305 | 334 | 241 | — |
| multi-line ×4 | 3–15 | 394 | 725 | 349 | — |
| **TOTAL ×12** | | **699** | **1059** | **590** | **480** |

Saved vs `str_replace`: hashline **360 (34%)** · oh-my-pi per-edit **469 (44%)** · oh-my-pi batch **579 (55%)**.

The script is deterministic by construction: a frozen corpus, a content-addressed edit script that
self-checks (a reformatted corpus throws instead of silently changing what's measured), a pinned
tokenizer, and oh-my-pi payloads validated against the package's published grammar before counting.
Because everything is fixed, `npm run benchmark` gives everyone the same result — the numbers in
this README are a snapshot of that run; regenerate, don't trust.

> **Scope & honesty.** The benchmark measures **request-payload tokens** — what the model emits per
> edit call — with identical read traffic excluded (it cancels) and identical replacement text.
> It does **not** model transcription failure and retries, which is where the real-world gap is
> largest: the original [harness-problem](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) post reported
> a **61% output-token reduction** and patch-failure drops from 46–51% to near zero after switching
> to anchored edits. It also does **not** model what a line-numbered format costs the model *between*
> calls — renumbering and re-fetching the file tag after every edit — nor block-op power, nor the
> Bun-vs-Node runtime difference, nor the fact that `@oh-my-pi/hashline` is a standalone patcher
> while this plugin is a dsh tool pair with `read`/`edit`/`undo`. Full methodology, the per-edit
> table, and the complete limitation list in [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md). The correctness gap behind those numbers is spelled out above in [Correctness in edge cases](#correctness-in-edge-cases).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| ------ | -------------- |
| `read` | Returns a file with every line as `HASH│content`. Parameters: `offset` (1-based), `limit`. Paged output ends with `[Showing lines N-M of T. Use offset=… to continue.]`. Lines >200KB are shown as a marker with a `sed` hint — hash anchors need full lines. |
| `edit` | Replaces a range of lines by hash. `path` · `remove_from` · `remove_to` · `replacement_text` (`""` deletes). Verifies **every line** of the resolved range against served state; `[E_RANGE_STALE]` / `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` / `[E_RANGE_UNVERIFIED]` reject-and-serve fresh anchors. |
| `batch_edit` | Up to 32 edits in one call: `{ edits: [{ path?, remove_from, remove_to, replacement_text }, …] }`. All items are preflighted; filesystem writes are sequential and rollback is best-effort. |
| `undo_last_edit` | `{ path }` reverts the last hashline edit, only while the file still matches the stored post-edit content; survives restarts. |

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[E_ACCESS]` | File exists but is not readable/writable by the tool. |
| `[E_AMBIGUOUS_ANCHOR]` | A hash matches more than one current line; call `read` for fresh anchors. |
| `[E_BAD_OP]` | Range end precedes range start (autocorrected when the pair was reversed). |
| `[E_BAD_REF]` | `remove_from`/`remove_to` is not a bare 3-char hash. |
| `[E_BAD_SHAPE]` | Request/field shape is wrong (unknown fields, missing path, non-string text, …). |
| `[E_BARE_HASH_PREFIX]` | `HASH│` prefix pasted into `replacement_text` (autocorrected). |
| `[E_BATCH_ABORT]` | A batch item failed; preflight rejects before writes, while write failures trigger best-effort rollback. |
| `[E_FILE_TOO_LARGE]` | File exceeds the hashline line ceiling; use `write` or another approach. |
| `[E_INVALID_PATCH]` | Diff-preview markers pasted into `replacement_text` (autocorrected). |
| `[E_NOOP_LOOP]` | The exact same edit keeps producing no change; resubmitting is rejected. |
| `[E_NOT_FOUND]` | File does not exist. |
| `[E_NOT_OBSERVED]` | The file has not been observed in this session (read-before-write policy); call `read` first. |
| `[E_NOT_TEXT]` | Path is a directory, binary, or non-UTF-8 file; hashline edits only text. |
| `[E_PLUGIN_INIT]` | The plugin could not initialize; hashline `read`/`edit` are disabled instead of falling back silently. |
| `[E_RANGE_STALE]` | A served line differs on disk since it was read; the range is echoed fresh. |
| `[E_RANGE_UNSERVED]` | The range includes lines never served to the model. |
| `[E_RANGE_UNVERIFIED]` | Boundary anchor cannot be verified against served state. |
| `[E_STALE_ANCHOR]` | Anchor(s) no longer resolve; call `read` for fresh anchors. |
| `[E_UNDO_STALE]` | Cannot undo: the file was modified (or deleted) after the edit. |
| `[E_UNDO_UNAVAILABLE]` | Undo history could not be persisted; the edit was not applied. |
| `[E_WOULD_EMPTY]` | An edit would empty a non-empty file; use `write` to clear it. |

## How It Replaces the Built-in Tools

dsh's tool registry resolves per scope: an agent sees `agent → preset → global`, and its **own**
layer always wins. The built-in `read`/`edit` live on the agent-preset layer, so a plain global
registration cannot replace them. This plugin:

1. Mounts as a host-plane Cordis plugin via its `cordis.patch.yml` bundle patch.
2. On `agent/session-start`, registers the hashline tools **and** the `tool:read` / `tool:edit`
   prompt sections on the agent's own scope layer — they shadow the preset's built-ins for that
   agent and unwind automatically when the agent is disposed.
3. Leaves the built-in `write` in place, but a scoped `tools/post-execute` listener appends the
   hashline auto-read to write results.

## Store

Hash snapshots, served-state rows, and undo history live in a private SQLite store below the DeepSeek
Harness home. Tool-call stores are keyed by workspace identity and opaque session key, so separate
remote sandboxes that reuse a POSIX cwd cannot share state. Outside a tool call, the workspace key is
used without a session suffix:

```
$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-better-edit/workspaces/<sha256-of-workspace-and-session>/hash-store.sqlite
```

The store directory is created with private permissions where the host supports them; the database
contains complete pre- and post-edit file contents. Keep the DSH home private and do not copy the
store into source control. Undo and served rows are isolated by session and path.

A 7-day TTL prunes served rows. Corrupt stores are quarantined and rebuilt automatically. Existing
workspace-local stores from releases before this layout are not migrated automatically.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest run
npm run build       # tsc → lib/
npm run benchmark   # reproducible token-cost benchmark (benchmark/)
```

### Releasing (tag-first)

```sh
npm run release -- 0.3.0                 # bump + CHANGELOG move + commit + tag + push → GitHub release
npm publish --registry https://registry.npmjs.org   # blocked until the version is tagged
```

`npm run release` bumps `package.json`/lockfile, moves the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section to the
version, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes — the tag push creates the GitHub release from the
changelog. `npm publish` refuses to run until that tag exists (prepublishOnly gate), so every npm
version is always already tagged and released.

The test suite is ported from pi-hashline-edit-lsz and drives the dsh tool builders directly over a
local filesystem bridge.

## Roadmap

**Current state (0.2.0):** hashline read/edit, batch_edit, session-scoped served and undo state,
private DSH-home storage, sandbox policy participation, and reproducible benchmark.

<details><summary>Next</summary>

- **Close or justify the gap vs @oh-my-pi/hashline** (reference: [`../oh-my-pi.md`](../oh-my-pi.md)). The sibling patch language is payload-lighter — 44%/55% vs our 34% vs `str_replace` on the benchmark, because a bare patch document skips the JSON envelope we pay per call — and offers four abilities we do not support: syntactic block ops (`PUT N*:`), registers + `REM`/`MV`, one multi-hunk document per change, and a pluggable filesystem. The counterweight is correctness: its line numbers are unverified (a wrong number on a current tag lands silently), every edit renumbers, stale tags trigger best-effort 3-way merge instead of verification, and the grammar raises the model skill floor. Decide each ability reject-or-adopt on its own merits — the payload gap alone is not a reason to switch formats.
- Verify the current dsh Agent composition with a real session.
- Upstream the served-tail truncation fix to pi-hashline-edit-lsz / upstream (their `upsertServed`
  never truncates either).
- Re-check plugin wiring against future dsh releases (validated against `0.1.0-rc.7`; dsh is in developer
  preview and promises breaking changes).

Hash-anchored editing descends from Can Bölük's
[*The Harness Problem*](https://stencil.so/blog/the-harness-problem) — the post that showed the
harness, not the model, is the bottleneck, and that anchored edits beat search-and-replace. This
project stands on the shoulders of:

- [**pi-hashline-edit**](https://github.com/RimuruW/pi-hashline-edit) by RimuruW — the original
